Proyect: Hell Tunes

Project Vision:
This project aims to develop a pixel-art bullet hell video game controlled with the keyboard arrow keys. 
The core idea is that the game launches projectiles or obstacles in sync with the rhythm of a song. 
The player won't only face a visual challenge but also an auditory and timing challenge, similar to rhythm-based games like "Just Shapes & Beats" 
or "Osu!mania", while keeping its own unique identity and mechanics.

Short-Term Goals (MVP - Minimum Viable Product):
- Create a game window using Pygame.
- Control a player character with the arrow keys.
- Load and play a fixed song.
- Detect beats using Librosa.
- Generate projectiles synchronized with detected beats.
- Implement basic collision detection between player and bullets.
- Display a "Game Over" screen when hit.

Mid-Term Goals:
- Allow the user to select and load their own music files.
- Increase the variety of rhythmic bullet patterns.
- Add basic enemies with defined shooting patterns.
- Create visual effects that match the music.
- Add a health bar or scoring system.

Long-Term Goals:
- Create a level editor so users can design their own rhythmic levels.
- Implement difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
- Add power-ups, special abilities, and themed levels.
- Export the game to multiple platforms (.exe, .apk, etc.).
- Build an active community that shares custom songs and levels.

Technologies:
- Main language: Python
- Game engine: Pygame
- Beat analysis: Librosa + Soundfile
- Version control: Git and GitHub

Developer Profile:
This project is developed by someone with strong knowledge of dynamic data structures (e.g., doubly linked lists, circular lists), 
object-oriented programming, algorithms, and complexity analysis. The goal is to apply and strengthen those skills while creating a 
fun, challenging, and original game.

License and Distribution:
Initially, the project will be open source and hosted on GitHub. 
In the future, it may be exported to platforms depending on its progress and potential.
